# Sign Language Translator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

The application is a Single Page Application which works as a sign language translator that translates written language into the american sign language. To use you have to setup a login profile by username and then you will be directed to the translator. On the translator page you type in a word in the input form and the letters will be displayed as sign language. On your profile page you can find your latest word translations as well as clear history and logout buttons.

## Installation

To clone this repository to your machine run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vendelaosterman/sign-language-translator.git
```

To install the required packages from NPM run the following commands in the project root folder:

```bash
npm install
npm install react-hook-form
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-icons --save
```
### External storage:

To be able to save and fetch data from an external API you have to follow the directions in [this API](https://gitlab.com/noroff-accelerate/javascript/projects/noroff-api/)

You then create two constants (REACT_APP_API_KEY and REACT_APP_API_URL) using the retrieved API URL and API key:


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
